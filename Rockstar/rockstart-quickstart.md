Below you see some example code written in Rockstar

### Example program

The following is a rockstar program that calculate the volume of a cylinder.

	Your soul is free
	Wonder is blood
	The body is hot. Temperature stop!
	The universe is nothing
	Put your soul of your soul of the body into the universe
	Whisper the universe of wonder

"Your soul is free" creates a variable *your_soul* and set it to 4 (since free has 4 letters)

"Wonder is blood" creates a variable *wonder* and set it to 5 (since blood has 5 letters)

The rest of the program calculate 

	radius*radius*3.14*length 

which in this case gives a volume of

	4*4*3.14*5 = 251.2


### Write hello

	Shout "thunder"

### Alternative

	Shout "thunder"
	Say "thunder"
	Whisper "thunder"
	Scream "thunder"


### Assign a variable and print the value

	Rockstar is 1337   (rockstar = 1337)
	Shout rockstar     (print rockstar)

### Assign a variables with "poetic literals"

	Rockstar is a big bad monster (rockstar = 1337)
	Shout Rockstar                

	Heaven is too far away (heaven = 334)
	Shout Heaven
	Shout Heaven

### Common variables

Common variables consist of one of the keywords **a, an, the, my** or **your** followed by a unique variable name, which must contain only lowercase ASCII letters a-z.

	My memories are painted in black (my_memories = 725)
	Whisper my memories

### Increase and decrease values

	My world is nothing       (my_world = nothing)
	Build my world up         (my_world++)
	Build my world up, up     (my_world += 2)
	Shout my world

	Knock my world down       (my_world--)
	Shout my world

### Create a function

This code:

	The heaven takes your heart and your soul    
	Give back your heart with your soul          

	My fire is your ice   (my_fire = 43)
	My love is your hate  (my_love = 44)

	Whisper the heaven taking my fire & my love   

Will be executed like:

	function the_heaven(your_heart, your_soul)
	return your_heart + your_soul

	my_fire = 43
	my_love = 44

	print the_heaven(my_fire, my_love)


### Last named variables

The keywords **it, he, she, him, her, they, them, ze, hir, zie, zir, xe, xem, ve,** and **ver** refer to the last named variable determined by parsing order.

	Your fantasy is a flaming heart (your_fantasy = 175)
	Shout it

	Janie's got a gun      (janie is got a gun => janie = 313)
	Build her up           (janie++)
	Say it

### If statements


	Tommy was a ladykiller                   (tommy = 10)
	Your fantasy is a flaming heart          (your_fantasy = 175)
	If Tommy is weaker than her shout Tommy  (if tommy < your_fantasy)

### Comparing

	Say "2" is 3                  (false)
	Say "2" ain't mysterious      (true)
	Say "2" is 2                  (true)

	If 2 is "3" say "yes" else say "no"  (no)
