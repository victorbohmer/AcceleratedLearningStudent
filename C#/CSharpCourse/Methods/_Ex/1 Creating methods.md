![9](Images/9.png) 

First solve this without using methods. Save this solution.

Look at your program. Try to divide the program into three (or more) methods.

1. Compare the new solutions (with methods) to the old. Did you get a better or worse solution?

2. Investigate access modifiers:

	    private, public, protected

Which is appropriate in your program?

## Hint

Read about methods

When solving this problem, create three metods: 

    string GetInputFromUser()
    string[] CreateArrayOfPeople(string response)
    void RespondToUser (string[] peopleArray)

To get the size of an array:

    myArray.Length
