## Extra

1. Create an app that ask for numbers (until QUIT) and then calculate the mean and median values of the list

2. Create an app that read monsters from and JSON-file. Create a List<Monster> and write the list in a pretty way to the screen.


## Hint

Use **RemoveAt** to remove a element:

    list.RemoveAt(3)

To sort a list:

    list.Sort()
